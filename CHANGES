NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::Docs::Changes - Revision history for DBIx::SQLEngine.

HISTORY
  Version 0.011

    2004-03-10 Moved driver-specific subclasses to a new Driver:: namespace
    and added documentation to each of them. The external public interface
    is identical, but this may break naughty code that checked ref() or
    isa(); however the fix is straightforward and this keeps our namespaces
    clearer. If your code was negatively impacted by this, let me know!

    2004-02-24 Integrated some patches from Michael Kroll, including new
    Oracle subclass, and created a new Criteria::StringComparison class as
    an alternate way of addressing an issue raised by another patch.

  Version 0.010

    2003-09-07 Released as DBIx-SQLEngine-0.010.

  Version 0.009

    2003-02-02 Released as DBIx-SQLEngine-0.009.

    2003-02-02 Merged the "Default" class used by AnyDBD into base class via
    stash aliasing, simplifying documentation.

  Version 0.008

    2002-11-02 Released as DBIx-SQLEngine-0.008.

    2002-11-02 Added basic subclass for MSSQL.

    2002-11-02 Added "is null" support based on patches from Michael Kroll
    at University of Innsbruck.

    2002-11-02 Added some introductory documentation to
    Criteria::Comparison.

    2002-11-02 For compatibility with the CPAN installer and automated
    testing tools, the Makefile.PL now suggests that you set your
    environment's DBI_DSN, rather than prompting you to enter it
    interactively in test.pl.

    2002-11-02 Refactored test script into several separate files.

    2002-11-02 Added initial basic transaction support.

  Version 0.007

    2002-05-24 Minor error-handling improvements.

    2002-05-24 Collect and return the results from visit_* methods.

    2002-05-24 Added DBIx::SQLEngine::Criteria::Not, contributed by
    Christian Glahn at University of Innsbruck.

    2002-04-10 Added "fetch without execute" to the catch_query_exception
    handler for MySQL and Pg.

  Version 0.006

    2002-03-23 Released as DBIx-SQLEngine-0.006.

    2002-03-23 Added basic support for passing SQL functions and expressions
    to SQLEngine::Default and SQLEngine::Critera::Comparison in a way that
    allows them to be used directly, rather than being treated as literals
    and bound to placeholders.

    2002-03-01 Fixed syntax errors in MySQL subclass. Fixed suspected
    Perl-version dependency (return from inside eval) in Default detect_any.

  Version 0.005

    2002-03-01 Released as DBIx-SQLEngine-0.005.

    2002-02-19 Simon: Added Pg catch_query_exception REDO for "out of range
    0..-1". I don't know what this error means but it always seems to
    succeed when we retry.

    2002-02-10 Simon: Modified format of error messages in Default.pm

    2002-02-02 Eliminated complaint about empty subclauses in
    Criteria::Compound

    2002-01-31 Extracted Default sql_* criteria handling into
    DBIx::SQLEngine::Criteria->auto* methods.

    2002-01-31 Added catch_query_exception to Pg subclass for automatic
    reconnection.

    2002-01-31 Created new Criteria::LiteralSQL package. Remove redundant
    parentheses around single-item list in Criteria::Compound.

    2002-01-30 Expanded Pg subclass. Fixed Default's type_info handling to
    not fall over when a type has multiple info hashes (needed for Pg).
    Adjusted error handling to call $sth->finish() if there's an exception
    after we prepare but before we complete retrieving the results.

    2002-01-27 Filled out documentation, especially of the public interface
    in SQLEngine.pm. Added skeletal Pg subclass.

  Version 0.003

    2002-01-25 Released as DBIx-SQLEngine-0.003

    2002-01-21 Fixed AnyData sql_create_column_text_long_type.

    detect_table methods.

    declarations. Completed DBIx::SQLEngine::Mixin::SeqTable. Added
    DBIx::SQLEngine::CSV.

    2002-01-14 Added initial version of DBIx::SQLEngine::Mixin::SeqTable.

    AnyDBD to not require non-standard patch.

  Version 0.001

    2001-06-28 Use DBIx::AnyDBD for platform-specific issues. Moved
    SQL-generation code from Table to SQLEngine.

    2001-06-28 Ported some Criteria classes from earlier code into the new
    SQLEngine class hierarchy.

    2001-06-27 Renamed from Adaptor to SQLEngine. Flattened class hierarchy;
    we're only going to support DBI. Expunged old code. Switched to new
    Class::MakeMethods distribution.
