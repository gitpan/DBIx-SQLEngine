NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::ReadMe - Introduction to DBIx::SQLEngine.

DESCRIPTION
    The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for DBI
    database handles, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation and
    query execution in a single call.

MOTIVATION
    This is the most recent version of a collection of libraries that I've
    used over the last several years to develop business data applications
    and object-relational mapping toolkits.

    Its goal is to simplify dynamic query execution with the following
    capabilities:

    *   Data-driven SQL: Ad-hoc generation of SQL statements from Perl data
        structures in a variety of formats.

    *   High-Level Interface: Standard operations are handled by a single
        method call each. Error handling is standardized.

    *   Full API Access: Pass-through arbitrary SQL and allow access to
        entire DBI API for cases when high-level interfaces are insufficient
        or inconvenient.

    *   Portability: Dynamic subclassing (via DBIx::AnyDBD) to allow
        platform-specific support for driver idiosyncrasies and DBMS
        workarounds.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

      DBI                   1.0
      DBIx::AnyDBD          2.0
      Class::MakeMethods    1.000_015

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    In order for the test to succeed, you must also have at least one
    working DBD module installed, and must provide a DSN to which the script
    can connect with permissions to create tables.

STATUS AND SUPPORT
    Version 0.002 is a preliminary release of DBIx::SQLEngine intended for
    public review and discussion

    Although it based on earlier code that was extensively tested over
    several years of production use, this code has recently been majorly
    refactored, and has not yet been sufficiently tested in its new form.

    The proposed CPAN module list entry is as follows:

      Name            DSLI  Description
      --------------  ----  ---------------------------------------------
      DBIx::
      :: SQLEngine    bdpo  Extends DBI with high-level operations
