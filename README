NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::Docs::ReadMe - Welcome to DBIx::SQLEngine

ABSTRACT
    The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for the DBI
    database framework. Each SQLEngine object is a wrapper around a DBI
    database handle, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation and
    query execution in a single call. Dynamic subclassing based on database
    server type enables cross-platform portability.

INTRODUCTION
    DBIx::SQLEngine is the latest generation of a toolkit used by the
    authors for several years to develop business data applications and
    object-relational mapping toolkits. Its goal is to simplify dynamic
    query execution with the following capabilities:

    *   High-Level Interface: Standard query operations are handled by a
        single method call each. Error handling is standardized, and routine
        annoyances like timed-out connections are retried automatically.

    *   Data-Driven SQL: Ad-hoc generation of SQL statements from Perl data
        structures in a variety of formats; simple hash and array references
        are flexibly converted to form clauses in standard SQL query syntax.

    *   Full DBI Access: Accepts arbitrary SQL queries with placeholder
        parameters to be passed through, and delegates any unknown method
        calls to the wrapped database handle, allowing access to the entire
        DBI API for cases when high-level interfaces are insufficient

    *   Portability Subclasses: Uses dynamic subclassing to allow
        platform-specific support for driver idiosyncrasies and DBMS
        workarounds. This release includes subclasses for connections to
        MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL servers, as well as for
        the standalone SQLite, AnyData, and CSV packages.

    *   Named Definitions: Enables pre-registration of a collection of names
        for sets of connection parameters, and a collection of of names for
        queries in either data-driven or plain-SQL formats. The definitions
        may include placeholders to be replaced by additional values at
        run-time.

    *   Object Mapping: An optional layer provides classes for Record, Table
        and Column objects which fetch and store information from a
        SQLEngine. The Schema objects call methods on a SQLEngine to fetch
        and store data, while the Record classes create new subclasses to
        correspond to rows in a particular table.

DISTRIBUTION AND INSTALLATION
  Version

    This version is a routine release of DBIx::SQLEngine intended for public
    use.

    This module's proposed CPAN registration should read:

      Name            DSLIP  Description
      --------------  -----  ---------------------------------------------
      DBIx::
      ::SQLEngine     Rdpop  Extends DBI with high-level operations

  Prerequisites

    This package requires these other modules and libraries:

      DBI                           1.0
      DBIx::AnyDBD                  2.0
      Class::MakeMethods            1.006

    You must also have at least one working DBD module installed.

    If you run into trouble, check that your DBI and DBD modules are
    up-to-date; in particular, if you are using DBD::CSV or DBD::AnyData,
    make sure you have upgraded to SQL::Statement 1.0 or later.

  Installation

    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBIx::SQLEngine'

    In order for the test to succeed, you must also have at least one
    working DBD module installed, and must provide a DSN to which the script
    can connect with permissions to create tables.

    Alternately, you may retrieve this package from CPAN or from the
    author's site:

    * http://search.cpan.org/~evo/

    * http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/E/EV/EVO

    * http://www.evoscript.org/DBIx-SQLEngine/

    After downloading the distribution, follow the normal procedure to
    unpack and install it, using the commands shown below or their local
    equivalents on your system:

      tar xzf DBIx-SQLEngine-*.tar.gz
      cd DBIx-SQLEngine-*
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test && sudo make install

    Furthermore, thanks to the kind generosity of other members of the Perl
    community, this distribution is also available repackaged in the FreeBSD
    "ports" and Linux RPM formats. This may simplify installation for some
    users, but be aware that these alternate distributions may lag a few
    versions behind the latest release on CPAN.

    * http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=perl-DBIx-SQLEn

  Tested Platforms

    This release has been tested succesfully on the following platforms:

      5.6.1 on darwin

BUGS AND SUPPORT
  Known Problems

    Many types of database servers are not yet supported.

    See the DBIx::SQLEngine::ToDo manpage for additional bugs and missing
    features.

  Release Status

    This module has been used in a variety of production systems and has
    been available on CPAN for over a year, with several other distributions
    dependant on it, so it would be fair to say that it is fully released.

    However, while the commonly-used portions are well tested, some of the
    more obscure combinations of options are less so, and new bug reports do
    trickle in occasionally. If you do encounter any problems, please inform
    the author and I'll endeavor to patch them promptly.

    Additional features have been outlined for future development, but the
    intent is support these by adding more options to the declaration
    interface, while maintaining backward compatibility.

  Support

    If you have questions or feedback about this module, please feel free to
    contact the author at the below address. Although there is no formal
    support program, I do attempt to answer email promptly.

    I would be particularly interested in any suggestions towards improving
    the documentation, correcting any Perl-version or platform dependencies,
    as well as general feedback and suggested additions.

    Bug reports that contain a failing test case are greatly appreciated,
    and suggested patches will be promptly considered for inclusion in
    future releases.

    To report bugs via the CPAN web tracking system, go to
    "http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=DBIx-SQLEngine" or send mail
    to "Dist=DBIx-SQLEngine#rt.cpan.org", replacing the "#" with "@".
