NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::Docs::ReadMe - Introduction to DBIx::SQLEngine.

DESCRIPTION
    The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for DBI
    database handles, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation and
    query execution in a single call.

MOTIVATION
    This is the most recent version of a collection of libraries that I've
    used over the last several years to develop business data applications
    and object-relational mapping toolkits.

    Its goal is to simplify dynamic query execution with the following
    capabilities:

    *   Data-driven SQL: Ad-hoc generation of SQL statements from Perl data
        structures in a variety of formats; simple hash and array references
        are flexibly converted to standard SQL syntax.

    *   High-Level Interface: Standard query operations are handled by a
        single method call each. Error handling is standardized.

    *   Full API Access: Pass-through arbitrary SQL and allow access to
        entire DBI API for cases when high-level interfaces are insufficient
        or inconvenient.

    *   Portability: Dynamic subclassing (via DBIx::AnyDBD) to allow
        platform-specific support for driver idiosyncrasies and DBMS
        workarounds; this release includes subclasses for connections to
        MySQL, Pg, Oracle, and MSSQL servers, as well as for the standalone
        SQLite, AnyData, and CSV packages.

DISTRIBUTION AND INSTALLATION
  Version

    This version is a routine release of DBIx::SQLEngine intended for public
    use.

    This module's proposed CPAN registration should read:

      Name            DSLIP  Description
      --------------  -----  ---------------------------------------------
      DBIx::
      ::SQLEngine     Rdpop  Extends DBI with high-level operations

  Prerequisites

    This package requires these other modules and libraries:

      DBI                           1.0
      DBIx::AnyDBD                  2.0
      Class::MakeMethods            1.003

    You must also have at least one working DBD module installed.

    If you run into trouble, check that your DBI and DBD modules are
    up-to-date; in particular, if you are using DBD::CSV or DBD::AnyData,
    make sure you have upgraded to SQL::Statement 1.0 or later.

  Installation

    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBIx::SQLEngine'

    In order for the test to succeed, you must also have at least one
    working DBD module installed, and must provide a DSN to which the script
    can connect with permissions to create tables.

    Alternately, you may retrieve this package from CPAN or from the
    author's site:

    * http://search.cpan.org/~evo/

    * http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/E/EV/EVO

    * http://www.evoscript.org/DBIx-SQLEngine/

    After downloading the distribution, follow the normal procedure to
    unpack and install it, using the commands shown below or their local
    equivalents on your system:

      tar xzf DBIx-SQLEngine-*.tar.gz
      cd DBIx-SQLEngine-*
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test && sudo make install

    Furthermore, thanks to the kind generosity of other members of the Perl
    community, this distribution is also available repackaged in the FreeBSD
    "ports" and Linux RPM formats. This may simplify installation for some
    users, but be aware that these alternate distributions may lag a few
    versions behind the latest release on CPAN.

    * http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=perl-DBIx-SQLEn

  Tested Platforms

    This release has been tested succesfully on the following platforms:

      5.6.1 on darwin

BUGS AND SUPPORT
  Known Problems

    Many types of database servers are not yet supported.

    Database driver/server combinations that do not support placeholders
    will fail.

    features.

  Release Status

    This module has been used in a variety of production systems and has
    been available on CPAN for over a year, with several other distributions
    dependant on it, so it would be fair to say that it is fully released.

    However, while the commonly-used portions are well tested, some of the
    more obscure combinations of options are less so, and new bug reports do
    trickle in occasionally. If you do encounter any problems, please inform
    the author and I'll endeavor to patch them promptly.

    Additional features have been outlined for future development, but the
    intent is support these by adding more options to the declaration
    interface, while maintaining backward compatibility.

  Support

    If you have questions or feedback about this module, please feel free to
    contact the author at the below address. Although there is no formal
    support program, I do attempt to answer email promptly.

    I would be particularly interested in any suggestions towards improving
    the documentation, correcting any Perl-version or platform dependencies,
    as well as general feedback and suggested additions.

    Bug reports that contain a failing test case are greatly appreciated,
    and suggested patches will be promptly considered for inclusion in
    future releases.

    To report bugs via the CPAN web tracking system, go to
    "http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=DBIx-SQLEngine" or send mail
    to "Dist=DBIx-SQLEngine#rt.cpan.org", replacing the "#" with "@".
