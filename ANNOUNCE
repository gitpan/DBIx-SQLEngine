ANNOUNCE: DBIx::SQLEngine 0.004

This is a preliminary release of DBIx::SQLEngine intended for public review.

Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

  The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for DBI
  database handles, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation and
  query execution in a single call, simplifying your database access code.

Suggestions and comments would be much appreciated. 

In particular, I'd be interested in answers to these questions:
- Does the "DBIx::SQLEngine" name make sense? 
- Is the documentation reasonably accessible?
- Does it test cleanly on various platforms and Perl versions?

Please send any feedback to me at simonm@cavalletto.org.

Thanks,

-Simon
