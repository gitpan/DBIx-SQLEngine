DBIx::SQLEngine::ToDo - Tasks, ideas, and bugs

=head1 TO DO

Although it based on earlier code that was extensively tested over several years of production use, this code has recently been majorly refactored, and has not yet been sufficiently tested in its new form.


=head2 Distribution

This version to be posted for review and discussion on DBI list, Perl Monks, and Perl Modules list.

The test script is fairly minimal and really ought to exercise the entire public interface.


=head2 Columns

The column-information retrieve in DBIx::SQLEngine::Default should be using DBI's type_info methods.


=head2 Interface

Extend the base interface with the following interfaces:

=over 4

=item *

fetch_select_with_limit

=item *

do_insert_with_sequence

=back


=head2 Transactions

There's no transaction support at this point; at least a basic version should be added.


=head2 Criteria

The Criteria subclasses are woefully incomplete. See the unfinished_code file for more.


=head2 Subclasses

Additional subclass logic will be required to support the following:

=over 4

=item *

All: type of long field

=item *

Oracle: single, trailing long.

=item *

MySQL, Oracle: downcase column names.

=item *

DB2: Long insertion via multiple updates.

=item *

Informix: escape newlines on insert/update/where and select

=back
