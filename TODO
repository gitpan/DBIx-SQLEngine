NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::ToDo - Tasks, ideas, and bugs

TO DO
    Although it based on earlier code that was extensively tested over
    several years of production use, this code has recently been majorly
    refactored, and has not yet been sufficiently tested in its new form.

    The test script is very minimal and really ought to exercise the entire
    public interface.

    The Criteria subclasses are woefully incomplete. See the unfinished_code
    file for more.

    The column-information retrieve in DBIx::SQLEngine::Default should
    probably be using DBI's type_info methods.

    Additional subclasses will be required to support the following:

    *   All: type of long field

    *   Oracle: single, trailing long.

    *   MySQL, Oracle: downcase column names.

    *   DB2: Long insertion via multiple updates.

    *   Informix: escape newlines on insert/update/where and select
