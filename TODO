NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::ToDo - Tasks, ideas, and bugs

TO DO
    Although it based on earlier code that was extensively tested over
    several years of production use, this code has recently been majorly
    refactored, and has not yet been sufficiently tested in its new form.

  Internals

    Review, perhaps switch to use of new DBI subclassing functionality in
    place of DBIx::AnyDBD.

  Distribution

    The test script is fairly minimal and really ought to exercise the
    entire public interface.

    For comapbility with the CPAN installer and automated testing tools, it
    may be more appropriate to query for a test DSN in the Makefile.PL,
    rather than in the test.pl.

  Columns

    The column-information retrieve in DBIx::SQLEngine::Default should be
    using DBI's type_info methods.

  Interface

    Extend the base interface with the following interfaces:

    *   fetch_select_with_limit

    *   do_insert_with_sequence

  Transactions

    There's no transaction support at this point; at least a basic version
    should be added.

  Criteria

    The Criteria subclasses are woefully incomplete.

  Subclasses

    Additional subclass logic will be required to support the following:

    *   All: type of long field

    *   Oracle: single, trailing long.

    *   MySQL, Oracle: downcase column names.

    *   DB2: Long insertion via multiple updates.

    *   Informix: escape newlines on insert/update/where and select
