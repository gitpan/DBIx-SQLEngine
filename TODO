NAME
    DBIx::SQLEngine::ToDo - Tasks, ideas, and bugs

TO DO
    Although it based on earlier code that was extensively tested over
    several years of production use, this code has recently been majorly
    refactored, and has not yet been sufficiently tested in its new form.

  Distribution

    This version to be posted for review and discussion on DBI list, Perl
    Monks, and Perl Modules list.

    The test script is very minimal and really ought to exercise the entire
    public interface.

  Immediate

    The column-information retrieve in DBIx::SQLEngine::Default should be
    using DBI's type_info methods.

    Extend the base interface with the following interfaces:

    *   fetch_select_with_limit

    *   do_insert_with_sequence

    Basic transaction support.

  General

    The Criteria subclasses are woefully incomplete. See the unfinished_code
    file for more.

    Additional subclasses will be required to support the following:

    *   All: type of long field

    *   Oracle: single, trailing long.

    *   MySQL, Oracle: downcase column names.

    *   DB2: Long insertion via multiple updates.

    *   Informix: escape newlines on insert/update/where and select
